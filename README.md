# **Tesla Car Range, Base Price and Exact Price Prediction - Machine Learning**
Tesla is a car brand. I have implemented a machine learning software that includes various car models and versions that Tesla has produced. This software based on multiple regression principles;

_1) Full price by range or base price,_

_2) Base price by range and full price,_

_3) Estimates range based on base price and full price._

As you can see in the image, the base price of our Model-3 Standard Range Plus version with a range of 263 and a full price of $ 54490 was estimated with an accuracy of 93.29570119776942. The data is completely prepared by me and taken from the website [https://www.solarreviews.com/blog/how-much-do-teslas-electric-vehicles-cost][DataSource].
